This project was developed for the means of the Eko Hackathon organized by the Goethe-Institute and FCSE Skopje and, as expected, is a short DEMO application (not fully functional).

All code was built from scratch, thus making our application fully independent of any outer modules. 

Short description:
Our application has the goal of connecting two target audiences.
The first group of people are those who visit various locations throughout the country, while the second group are eco-activists, members of non-government/non-profitable
organizations and other similar groups that organize ecology events for taking care of the environment.
Every user of our Web application will be able to mark a location where they have found garbage, by selecting the location on a map and uploading an image of the scene
in order for a responsible person to confirm that location as valid.
The other thing the users can do is search through locations that were tagged as places with garbage in order to help them with some of the steps of their organization of 
eco-events.
The users that register will be able to start an event by tagging the location where they plan to go so other users can join.
Every user will have a profile where you can complete tasks, such as fist location cleaned or tagged a polluted area, to earn points which in collaboration with sponsors can be
used to redeem coupons for discounts.
Rank list for the users with the largest amount of points.
Progress bar of the total amount of tagged locations compared to all the cleaned locations.

**DISCLAIMER: Not all of the things mentioned are implemented, some may be a work in progress or to be implemented in the future.**
